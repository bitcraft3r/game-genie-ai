# Game Genie AI 

A Game Concept and Content Generation Tool

## Description

Game Genie AI is a website that leverages OpenAI and Stable Diffusion technology to provide game creators with an AI-powered toolkit to effortlessly generate game concepts, stories, art, and content. 

With the **Chat** and **Dream** features, users can interact with the AI and create anime-style profile picture images with text. 

The **Wish** feature expands the capabilities of the chatbot and stable diffusion by allowing users to create:
- *Game concepts* from ideas and game names, to designing campaigns and quests
- *Imaginative game worlds* with *immersive stories*, characters, game art, and 
- *Viral content* for social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter.

### Technical Used

- React
- `openai` package
- [Fine-tuned stable diffusion model](https://twitter.com/sov3333/status/1618563856649052160)
- `express` server for interacting with openai and huggingface api
- `file-saver` and `react-csv` packages to save images and csv files
- `firebase` and `react-google-button` packages for "sign in with google"
- `dotenv` for keys/secrets storage

## APIs Used

1. OpenAI - Completions API: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction

GPT-3 powered API for performing natural language tasks by providing text completion based on inputted prompts.

2. Hugging Face - Inference API: https://huggingface.co/inference-api

Free ML API for building, training, deploying, and interacting with ML models, including pre-trained models or user-uploaded fine-tuned models.

3. Firebase Authentication - Login with Google: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth

Firebase Authentication offers backend services, SDKs, and UI libraries for authenticating app users via password, phone, popular federated identity providers, etc.

4. Firestore serverless database - Track user actions: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore

Firestore is a NoSQL document database, and can be directly accessed by mobile and web applications through native SDKs.

## Planning and Development Process

1. Research and Ideation: Started with researching and gaining knowledge about AI and OpenAI API, and then decided to create a project related to AI. Initial idea was to create a Q&A chatbot using OpenAI API.

2. Implementing OpenAI API: Implemented the OpenAI completions API for simple prompting, with a focus on functionality rather than the user interface.

3. Brainstorming: After the basic chat function was done, brainstormed to add more features and functionalities to the project.

4. Adding new features: Decided to add a text-to-image function, using Stable Diffusion, to generate anime-style profile picture images with text.

5. Wish feature: To provide users with more ways to use the chatbot and stable diffusion, added a "Wish" feature that allows users to generate concepts, imaginative game worlds, game art, and viral content.

6. Getting feedback to iterate.

7. Continued development: Continued developing and improving the project, with a focus on functionality, usability, and user experience.

### Problem-Solving Strategy

- Writing down ideas and drawing mindmaps to visualize 
- ChatGPT, Google, and YouTube Tutorials
- GameGenie -> generated the name idea, images used for the badges & chat log profile pics

### Biggeset Challenges

1. State management architecture
- Which state management method for different situation? 
- Where is most efficient/effective to initialize state?

- useContext - global state
- useState
- useReducer - not tried
- useRedux - not tried

2. Organizing the file structure as the project gets bigger

3. Server on production
- unable to get API calls to work on prod.

4. Leaderboard 
- not sure what data stucture to use, 
- can't get userList from Firebase, 
- will be challenging to map Firebase user data to Firestore activity data.

### Unsolved problems & TODO

- Get the f*** off localhost!!! Deployed `server` to production w Firebase but currently not working.
- Refreshing on `/account` page will break the page
- Getting data of users & their stats to display on `Leaderboard` page, gamification e.g. badges and more
- Upgrade to Next.js for better page/router handling (multi pages with individiual metatitle and meta description)
- Organize file structure, refactor code to DRY
- Material UI, design, and mobile responsiveness
- Explore new features, e.g.:
    - Storyboard feature which combines existing feautres e.g. Storyline+Character+Dream -> to create a story/comic with dialogue and images.
    - Design custom avatar, with 5 separate parts, from text. E.g. crown, jacket, katana, leather pants, cros.
    - Mint avatar pfp images generated as NFT

## Setup
